    "Blind Signal Separation or Blind Source Separation is the separation of a set of source signals from a set of mixed signals, without the aid of information (or with very little information) about the source signals or the mixing process. The set of individual source signals, $s(t)$ = ($s_{1}(t)$, ... , $s_{n}(t)$) is mixed using a matrix, A = [$a_{ij}$] which belongs to $R^{mxn}$ to produce a set of 'mixed' signals, x(t) = ($x_{1}(t)$, ...., $x_{m}(t))^T$. \n",
