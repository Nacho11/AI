This project contains the code for a self driving car artificial intelligent agent. The starter code was provided by Udemy.
The sdc.py file was implemented by me and contains comments on the different concepts used to develop the agent. The map_commented.py
file consists of the map file with comments of what each line does.
Used PyTorch and Kivy opensource libraries.
The last_brain.pth file is one of the loaded models.
Running - python map.py
